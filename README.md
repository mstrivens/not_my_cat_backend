# Not My Cat ✧/ᐠ-ꞈ-ᐟ\

Not My Cat is a responsive single-paged web app providing a platform for cat lovers to track, collect and play with cats in the real world. Our users can create a cat, with name, picture, attributes and their location stored using the Google Maps API. They can then play against randomised cats, to increase their win total and win crowns. Finally they can see where other cats have been spotted and go out to spot these neighbourhood felines.

We created Not My Cat as part of our final project at Makers Academy, a 12 week web development bootcamp. We used the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node.js)

## implementation of the Express.js server

- `npm init`
- npm install dependancies
  - [x] `dotenv` for accessing enviroment data needed to connect to Mongodb
  - [x] `express` for the router functions
  - [x] `mongoose` for connecting and carrying out actions on Mongodb
  - [x] `supertest` for testing requests to the router
  - [x] `jest` as a testing framework, coverage and more
  - [x] `nodemon` to rolling restart the server on saved changes
  - [x] `eslint` as a linter
  
- updated scripts in the package.json
```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage --colors"
  }
```

- added dirs: 
  - [x] models
  - [x] config
  - [x] routes/api
  - [x] test/helper
  
- touch:
  - [x] `./app.js`
  - [x] `./test/app.test.js`
  - [x] `./test/users.test.js`
  - [x] `./config/db.js`
  - [x] `./.env`
  - [x] `./routes/api/users.js`
  - [x] `./models/user.js`
  
- added jest configuration to package.json
```json
"jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "testTimeout": 10000
  }
```
### app.js

- `app.js` is updated to pull in express.js and a few of the other dependancies and the empty routes files, a test is written for a basic route and then the route added to pass. 
- A port is assigned to the server.
- Middleware is added to the `app.js` to ensure that `json` can be parsed for post requests. (**This has to be declared before any of the routes otherwise it will lead to errors where no body is passed to the post routes.**)
- The db connection method is delcared for dev and production envs.

### users.test.js

- Requires `app`, `testSetup` and `supertest` to be pulled in.
- The tests are in a familiar format in `jest` to `jasmine` and `rspec` et al. 
- The `request` const, instantisation of supertest allows you to make requests to the server from the test suite. 
- Tests involving requests must be async or use the done callback.

### model/user.js

- A `mongoose` schema object that defines the user model in our case. the mongoose documentation helps with how we can define our attributes.
- The function `userSchema.pre("save")` allows us to do things to data before it is saved to the database, in this instance we are gonna encrypt the password with `Bcrypt`.
- The function `userSchema.methods.isValidPassword()` is used to check the password for when the user wants to login or authenticate. It returns a `boolean`.

### config/db.js

- Using `mongoose` to create functions to connect to and disconnect from the database. 
- We use the env variable `MONGO_URI` which we access using `dotenv` to connect to the database and make sure that our credentials are not pushed to github.

### test/helper/dbHelper.js

- This helper file allows the tests to connect to the database use a `beforeAll` and `afterAll` function. 
- Also there are `beforeEach` and `afterEach` functions that create stand up test data and tear it down so that each of the tests can be carried out in a clean environment. 
- This file calls on `testData.json` that contains the data for the test database seeding.
